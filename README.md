## About
   AstraDB Spotlight Client is an open source project developed using Vue3, TailwindCSS 3, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Its goal is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for viewing data stored in Datastax's AstraDB. As the project is in its early stages, any help is welcome in contributing to the development and improvement of the project.

## How it works
   AstraDB Spotlight Client is a software that connects to the AstraDB database through its REST API. It allows users to make requests to this API to view and manage their data. To use the client, users need to generate an API token on the AstraDB website and enter that token in the corresponding field in the client. This will allow them access to their database and the client interface will become more intuitive and easy to use.

## Local Development
   If you are running AstraDB Spotlight Client locally, you can create a connections file in .json format called "astradb_connections.json" and follow the model of the "example.astradb_connections.json" file. This will allow you to save your connections locally, without having to enter the connection information every time you start the client.
